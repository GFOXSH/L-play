# L-play
Allows to play some games on legacy PCs

With this program you can automatically:

* run games at high priority to avoid crashes;
* run games with selected process affinity;
* connect Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform for DirectX 10/11 emulation;
* connect SwiftShader for advanced Direct3D 9 emulation;
* connect Mesa3D for OpenGL 3 emulation;
* connect Direct3D 8 to 9 shim;
* connect WineD3D to emulate some missing DirectX APIs; 
* use MemReduct to clean RAM.

To use most of the features, you need to place the required libraries and executables in folders inside L-play.
